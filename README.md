# Using Test Doubles To Improve Your Developer Confidence

This is the repository for the sample code for the CodeMash precompiler on Wednesday, January 15, 2025.

## Setup

Please see the [Setup](./setup.md) guide to prepare your laptop for this training. You can accomplish these steps any time before the precompiler begins.

## This Repository

I will add sample projects to this repository in the `/src` directory, as well as other resources we will use during the pre-compiler.

### Before you leave for the conference (e.g. **not before January 10, 2025**) 

**Making a copy of this repository on your laptop**

Open a shell/terminal on your laptop and create a directory for the code for this pre-compiler, for example:

```sh
mkdir test-doubles-code-mash
cd test-doubles-code-mash
```

In that directory, run the following command:

```sh
npx degit hypertheorytraining/test-doubles
```

This will download the latest version of this repository without the git history so you will have a "fresh clean" copy of the starter code.

After the code has downloaded navigate into the `src/frontend` directory and run `npm ci`.

```sh
cd src/frontend
npm ci
```
